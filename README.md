# The Graydocs

Personal project docs site for stuff made by yours truly.

## What kind of projects are hosted here?

Yes.

...All of them, in some capacity. If a project's documentation I make is moved elsewhere it's because I either felt it needed a more uniquely branded site, or because the project is large scale enough it just makes more sense. Regardless, any project I make has at least one README file on here, and will provide a link to it's specific docs if it has them elsewhere.

## What's this made of?

Just a few simple ingredients:
- Astro (SSG)
- Starlight (Docs theme for Astro)
- Catppuccin Theme for Starlight (running Mocha palette for dark mode and Latte for light mode)
- Bun (of course)
